Macintosh 68k Schematics
========================

Bomarc Services reverse engineered several Apple Macintosh computers in the
1990s and sold the schematics to companies providing products or services
that needed such documentation. Bomarc Services has now disappeared. I have
done my best to track down the documents and process them for preservation.

The Bomarc schematics were distributed on heavily watermarked, photocopied
color paper. The only copies to be found were black and white scans. They
were difficult to read in their original form due to the heavy watermarking
and poor contrast. This collection represents hundreds of hours of retouching
to restore the scans to something useful. In retrospect, the time might have
been better spent re-drawing them from scratch. In any case, they are now
much improved over the original scans, despite many flaws still present.

Also included are some Apple schematics. These are mostly incomplete.
